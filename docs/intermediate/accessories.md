!!! tip "Rubber duck debugging"
    Tell someone else, in logical steps, about the maddening, infuriating, completely impossible bug or problem you have. The act of writing the problem down - be it in a StackOverflow post, an email, or a WhatsApp message - quite often triggers an "Ohhhhhhh" (realisation) moment, and you've solved it yourself by explaining it to your own brain. This so common it even has a name - [the Rubber Duck Debugging technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).
    
    I've done this so often. Sometimes I still send the email to thank the person for having solved it for me, even though they never knew they had.
