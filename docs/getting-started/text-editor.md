# Which text editor?

Another source of needless options paralysis, is "Which text editor shall I use for my code?".

There are many available (hundreds, at least), and they cater for all sorts of needs 

## Use VSCode

Microsoft VSCode is a really nice, stable and feature-packed editor which has come from 'nowhere' to being one of the most commonly used text editors,in just a couple of years. It is simple enough to be 'simple' for the people that like simple. But it can be extended using extenstions to have lots of helpful features, which make it more like an 'Integrated Development Environment'. It has lots of extensions which make it easy to handle Git and GitHub repositories, many different coding practices and styles, and even things like Docker containers.

It's free and open source. I strongly recommend it. In the end you may settle on something different, but VSCode will get you through anything in this book.
