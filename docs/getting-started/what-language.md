# Q: What Language Should I Learn?

!!! success ""
     **A: PYTHON!**

One of the first problems that you hit when learning to code is the question of which language to learn.

I'm going to end that 'options paralysis' for you right now by advising, no - _asking_ - you to learn Python. Why 'asking'? - because I believe that as Clinicians Who Code we have to band together and collectivise around a language that we can all use, and more importantly, we need to build tools that solve problems and then **share** those tools widely and openly in standard ways like using the [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), the Python Package Index.

If that's enough for you, then you can skip right on to learning how to Python! You will learn other tools later. But start with Python.

But if you need some more in-depth reasoning for why to learn Python, then read on.

## Why it matters to get on and learn Python **now**, and then learn other stuff later

When I started wanting to code, I asked some friends what would be a good language to learn. I got a variety of answers, but it took me some time to make decent conclusions about whether they were the right things to learn.

One person said "Learn Java because it's 'Enterprise-y' and healthcare applications sound like they are Enterprise-y". Another advised me to start with the basics and learn C or C++ so that I could write super-fast programs. I actually bought books on both of these and really didn't hit it off with either. I then tried Python and subesquently Ruby, and I immediately found them more friendly and straightforward. I've also played around with fashionable languages like Elixir and Golang, as well as PHP, Javascript, and 

This is a roundabout way of saying that none of the languages you could choose are 'right' or 'wrong'. But I do think that by concentrating the resources of the Clinicians Who Code community around Python, we can make more progress than if we spread ourselves across numerous languages, tools and frameworks.
