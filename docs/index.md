# The Opinionated Handbook

Welcome to this handbook, which has been written to be the guide I wished I'd had when I started coding.

If you have enjoyed it and would like to see it improved, extended and updated, then please consider donating and supporting the project.


## Complete beginners to tech
If you are a total beginner in tech, then please feel especially welcome. Everyone can learn more about tech than they already know. Every day you can move a little further along the scale. Beginners may wish to start with content under the Basics tab, to get some definitions and general concepts under their fingers first.

## A little tech experience
If you already know what clients and are what servers do, and have a clue about cloud, then you could possibly skip Basics and go staright to Getting Started.
