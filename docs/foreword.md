## Why is this book needed?

This book is the book I wish I'd had available to me back in about 2011 when I started getting back interested in code.

I'd been a 'computery nerd type' at high school and sixth-form college, but I didn't touch computers much from 1995 to about 2002. I got a laptop in 2002 but I only used it for email and web and to write revision notes for the various medical exams I was doing at the time.

When I was doing GP training, between 2008 and 2011, I started to get more interested in the computers we were using clinically.
