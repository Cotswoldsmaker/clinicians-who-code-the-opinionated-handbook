# Conventions used in this book

## Commands and code snippets

Commands that you run by typing into the Command Prompt (Windows), Terminal (MacOS/Linux) or Python console are in monospaced 'typerwriter' font like this

`some code`

``` python
>>> print('this is a command')
```

Where you need to insert your own details into a command I've used angle brackets and capitals so it looks like `<THIS_KIND_OF_THING>`:

``` python
my_secret_api_key = "<INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>"
```

Full-size code snippets have a small 'copy' icon in the top right, which will copy the command to your clipboard for easy pasting.

## Tips

!!! tip "Marcus's Random Tips"
    Scattered through the book, formatted in these 'tip' boxes, I've included some tips and advice which I've either learned from opther places during my time in tech, or which I've concluded myself. I've tried to make them interesting and actionable. (I'm sure you'll tell me if they aren't)
