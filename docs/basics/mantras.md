I've collected together some thoughts for when you need them

1. Anyone who is suitably motivated can learn to code. Anyone.
1. A person who is a clinician of any kind, is *by definition* intelligent and motivated and capable. That's **you**.
1. You can get yourself un-stuck.
1. If you find something hard, **that's** exactly when you're learning. Take a moment to recognise that feeling of difficulty, maybe even frustration. **Own** it. Acknowledge that **it is hard because you're learning**, not because of any other imagined reason such as that you are inadequate or don't have the right sort of brain. 
1. Never give up. By all means put the work away till tomorrow, till next week, till next year. But come back to it with new eyes and you'll see where you were going wrong.
1. Never underestimate the problem solving potential of a decent night's sleep. If you really can't make it work, put it away for the night. Over night, quite often, the solution will be obvious in the morning.
2. Tell someone else, in logical steps, about the maddening, infuriating, completely impossible bug or problem you have. The act of writing the problem down - be it in a StackOverflow post, an email, or a WhatsApp message - quite often triggers an "Qhhhhhhh" (realisation) moment, and you've solved it yourself by explaining it to your own brain. This so common it even has a name - [the Rubber Duck Debugging technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)
3. Fix one little thing in your workflow every day. This could be by simply adding a plugin to your editor
