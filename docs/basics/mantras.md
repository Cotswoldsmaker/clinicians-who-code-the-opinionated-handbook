# Mantras

I've collected together some thoughts for when you need them

!!! tip
    Anyone who is suitably motivated can learn to code. Anyone.
    

!!! tip
    A clinician of any kind, any level, and any background, is *by definition* intelligent and motivated and capable. That's **you**. You can learn to code just as you learned all the other things you needed to learn to develop your professional skills.

!!! tip
    You can get yourself un-stuck.

!!! tip
    If you find something hard, **that's** exactly when you're learning. Take a moment to recognise that feeling of difficulty, maybe even frustration. **Own** it. Acknowledge that **it is hard because you're learning**, not because of any other imagined reason such as that you are inadequate or don't have the right sort of brain. 

!!! tip
    Never give up. By all means put the work away till tomorrow, till next week, till next year. But come back to it with new eyes and you'll see where you were going wrong.

!!! tip
    Never underestimate the problem solving potential of a decent night's sleep. If you really can't make it work, put it away for the night. Over night, quite often, the solution will be obvious in the morning.

!!! tip
    Tell someone else, in logical steps, about the maddening, infuriating, completely impossible bug or problem you have. The act of writing the problem down - be it in a StackOverflow post, an email, or a WhatsApp message - quite often triggers an "Qhhhhhhh" (realisation) moment, and you've solved it yourself by explaining it to your own brain. This so common it even has a name - [the Rubber Duck Debugging technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)



!!! tip
    Listen to, and act on, EVERY LITTLE THING that [Joe McDonald](https://twitter.com/CompareSoftware) says. Always.

!!! tip
    Know where Abilene, TX is and [why you do not want to go there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFQ-ukyvAMk). Recognise when other people are going there. Know where the [Zone Of Uncomfortable Debate](https://www.bartoninsights.com/the-zoud/) is, and go there as often as is necessary.

!!! tip
    Know what a Million Pound Chair is actually worth.
