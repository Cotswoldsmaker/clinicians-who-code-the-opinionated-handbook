# Clinicians Who Code

An _opinionated_ guide for clinicians who want to build tech safely, openly, and quickly.

# Foreword

# Introduction

## Why so opinionated?

- we need to collectivise our efforts behind a single language so that we focus on developing the ecosystem of tools and libraries of code that we need. If we're spread across many languages then we simply won't hit a 'critical mass'
